`enrouter` is a file based router library for React.

**Please, be aware that the API is not stable yet and can be changed before
reaching `v1.0.0`.
The author is endeavouring to find the simplest and most elegant API & DX**

## Install

```bash
pnpm add -D enrouter
```

## Requirements

- JavaScript

  The library is written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript/ES2023 in
  ESM format.

- React

  Currently `react@rc` is being used as a dependency. `v1.0.0` is expeceted to
  be compatible with React 18 and 19.

- Vite

  `enrouter` relies on `vite`/`rollup` "virtual module" feature for generating
  routes from source modules.
