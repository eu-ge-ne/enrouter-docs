enrouter is a file-based router library for React. It is written in TypeScript
and compiled to ES2023.

**Please, be aware that the API is not stable yet and can be changed before
reaching `v1.0.0`.
The goal is to find the simplest and most elegant API & DX**

## Install

```bash
pnpm add -D enrouter
```

## Requirements

- Currently `react@rc` is being used as a dependency. `v1.0.0` is expected to be
  compatible with React 18 and 19.
- It relies on Vite/Rollup "virtual module" feature for generating routes
  from source modules.

## Environments

enrouter runs in all modern browsers, on the edge and Node.js.
