# matchLocation

```ts
function matchLocation(location: string): Promise<Match[]>;
```

Generates a list of `Match` objects for a given location.

This function is the backbone of enrouter.
It is invoked, either explicitly or implicitly, whenever you need to:

- Render a server-side response (SSR)
- Hydrate the user interface
- Update the UI in response to link navigation

## Examples

### SSR

```tsx
import { matchLocation, StaticRouter } from "enrouter";

const matches = await matchLocation(req.url);

const stream = await React.renderToReadableStream(
  <StaticRouter location={req.url} matches={matches} />,
);

return new Response(stream, {
  status: 200,
  headers: { "Content-Type": "text/html" },
});
```

### Hydrate

```tsx
import { matchLocation, BrowserRouter } from "enrouter";

const matches = await matchLocation(window.location.pathname);

React.hydrateRoot(document, <BrowserRouter matches={matches} />);
```

## Match Object

```ts
interface Match {
  route: Route;
  isExact: boolean;
  location: string;
  params: Record<string, string>;
}
```

The `Match` object represents a route corresponding to a segment of the location.
It encapsulates:

- `route`: The matched route instance.
- `isExact`: A flag indicating if the match fully aligns with the location.
- `location`: The matched location string.
- `params`: An object containing the route parameters.

Additionally, each `Match` object links to adjacent matches in the sequence (first, last, previous, and next).

### Example

For the location `/docs/api`, `matchLocation` generates a list of `Match` objects corresponding to:

1. /
2. /docs
3. /docs/api

### Working with Matches

You generally donâ€™t need to work directly with `Match` objects.
Instead, `enrouter` provides hooks like `useMatch` and `useActive` for convenient access to the match list and associated functionality.
